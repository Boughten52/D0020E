There are 3 config files
 - Information containing connections and user information
 - All saved rulesets
 - All possible inputs and outputs

A default is set for them in a file called:
 \"configLocations.txt\"

Note also that the interface program has to be in the same directory as the main python file. With that, as long as you can run the python file, then you should be able to run the interface

As long as you don't have mac, working on fixing that"

# D0020E - Rule-based activity recognition

This project is a part of the course D0020E at Lule√• University of Technology.

The purpose of the project is to provide a configurable system for setting up rules for activity recognition
in the Human Health and Activity Laboratory (H2Al) at LTU. H2Al is like a smart home containing multiple different
sensors and tools, and it is used for e.g. studying human behaviour. The lab is currently lacking a system that
easily connects different types of sensors and this project aims to meet that need.

Refer to the [GitHub Page](https://boughten52.github.io/D0020E/) for installation and how to run the application, as well as instructions on how to add new input or output.
